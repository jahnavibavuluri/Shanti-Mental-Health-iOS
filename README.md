# Shanti-Mental-Health-iOS

## Overview
Shanti Mental Health Application was designed specifically to combat the rapid increase of mental
health issues as a result of COVID-19 by creating a user specific platform that builds a path towards 
better mental health. Through a Daily Quiz, the users' mental health is calibrated in 5 major areas: 
Rumination, Persistent Worrying, Self Criticism, Negative Thinking, and Decision Making. Based on the results, 
the application recommends certain activites for the user to complete that are proven to show positive results. 
The app also tracks past results and displays them for the user. Past activites are also recorded. 
This web appication is an extention of the mobile app, which you can download

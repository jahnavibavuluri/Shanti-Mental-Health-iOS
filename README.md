# Shanti-Mental-Health-iOS

## Overview
Shanti Mental Health Application was designed specifically to combat the rapid increase of mental health issues as a result of COVID-19 by creating a user specific platform that builds a path towards better mental health. Through a Daily Quiz, the users' mental health is calibrated in 5 major areas: Rumination, Persistent Worrying, Self Criticism, Negative Thinking, and Decision Making. Based on the results, the application recommends certain activites for the user to complete that are proven to show positive results. The app also tracks past results and displays them for the user. Past activites are also recorded. You can download the iOS application [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shanti-mental-health-app/id1529500894).

This repository displays the frontend and backend code written for the finalized application now available for FREE download on the app store. This application cannot be run from a personal computer. If you want to run this application, download the app on an Apple iPhone.
